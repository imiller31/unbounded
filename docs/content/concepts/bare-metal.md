## When to Use Bare Metal Provisioning

Use metalman when you have physical servers that need to be:

- **Netbooted** from bare metal (no pre-installed OS).
- **Reimaged** on demand without physical access.
- **Power-managed** remotely via Redfish BMC APIs.
- **Securely bootstrapped** using TPM 2.0 hardware attestation.

If your machines already have Linux installed and are reachable via SSH, use the
[SSH provisioning path]({{< relref "guides/ssh" >}}) instead.

## How PXE Boot Works

PXE (Preboot Execution Environment) is a firmware feature that lets a machine
boot from the network instead of a local disk. metalman acts as the PXE
infrastructure:

![PXE boot flow: Bare-Metal Machine boots via DHCP, TFTP, and HTTP from metalman, then joins the Kubernetes API with a bootstrap token](../../img/bare-metal-pxe-boot.svg)

The boot flow in detail:

1. **DHCP Discovery** -- The machine's PXE firmware broadcasts a DHCP request.
   metalman responds with an IP address and the location of the bootloader.

2. **TFTP Boot** -- The firmware downloads the bootloader via TFTP.

3. **HTTP Artifacts** -- The bootloader fetches the kernel, initramfs, and
   configuration files from metalman's HTTP server. These are sourced from
   the Machine's `spec.pxe.netbootImage`, or from Metalman's default netboot
   image when that field is omitted.

4. **Kernel Boot** -- The machine boots into the downloaded kernel and
   initramfs.

5. **Token Retrieval** -- The init process contacts metalman's health endpoint
   to retrieve a bootstrap token. If TPM 2.0 is available, the token is
   encrypted to the machine's TPM.

6. **Cluster Join** -- kubelet uses the bootstrap token to join the Kubernetes
   cluster, just like an SSH-provisioned node.

7. **Node Ready** -- machina detects the new Node object and transitions the
   Machine to the **Ready** phase.

## Key Concepts

### DHCP Modes

metalman supports two DHCP modes depending on your network topology:

- **Interface mode** (`--dhcp-interface eth0`) -- metalman listens for
  broadcast DHCP on a specific NIC. Use this when metalman runs on the same
  L2 segment as the bare-metal machines.

- **Relay mode** (default, no `--dhcp-interface`) -- metalman listens for
  unicast DHCP forwarded by a DHCP relay agent. Use this when metalman and
  the machines are on different subnets.

### OCI Images

Metalman uses two OCI images during PXE provisioning:

- The machine image, referenced by `spec.pxe.image`, contains `/disk/disk.img.gz`.
- The netboot image, referenced by `spec.pxe.netbootImage` or by Metalman's
  default, contains the reusable PXE boot environment.

Netboot images are built `FROM scratch` and contain all files needed for PXE
booting a machine under `/disk/`. Files with a `.tmpl` suffix are Go templates
rendered per-machine at serve time; other files are served verbatim. A
`metadata.yaml` file provides image-level configuration such as
`dhcpBootImageName`.

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Binary artifacts** | Kernel, initramfs, bootloader - served verbatim from the OCI image |
| **Templates** | Files with `.tmpl` suffix - rendered from Go templates with per-machine context (e.g., kernel command line) |
| **Configuration** | `metadata.yaml` - image-level settings such as the DHCP boot filename |

Machine and netboot images are pulled and cached locally by the OCI reconciler.

### Machine CRD (PXE Fields)

For PXE-provisioned machines, the `Machine` resource includes:

- **`spec.pxe.image`** -- OCI machine image reference containing `/disk/disk.img.gz`
  (e.g. `"ghcr.io/azure/host-ubuntu2404:v1"`).
- **`spec.pxe.architecture`** -- Optional target CPU architecture for PXE boot
  artifacts and machine images. Defaults to `amd64`; allowed values are `amd64`
  and `arm64`.
- **`spec.pxe.netbootImage`** -- Optional OCI netboot image reference containing
  PXE boot artifacts. When omitted, Metalman uses its configured default
  `netboot` image.
- **`spec.pxe.dhcpLeases`** -- NIC specifications: MAC address and IP
  assignment for each interface. During install, the default netboot template
  passes the matching lease MAC to the initrd so it can select the provisioning
  NIC without relying on names such as `eth0`.
- **`spec.pxe.targetDisk`** -- Optional block device path for the disk that
  receives the machine image. Set this on hosts with multiple disks; when
  omitted, the installer selects a disk automatically.
- **`spec.pxe.redfish`** -- Optional BMC connection details (endpoint, username,
  password secret) for remote power management.
- **`spec.pxe.cloudInit`** -- Optional cloud-init customization. References a
  ConfigMap containing user-data that is merged with the vendor-data managed by
  Unbounded.

### Site Isolation

In environments with multiple metalman instances (e.g., different racks or
sites), the `--site` flag scopes each instance to machines labeled with
`unbounded-cloud.io/site=<name>`. This prevents one metalman from interfering
with another's machines.

### TPM 2.0 Attestation

metalman uses TPM 2.0 for secure bootstrap token delivery:

1. **Endorsement Key (EK) TOFU** -- On first boot, the machine presents its
   TPM Endorsement Key. metalman records it using a Trust-On-First-Use model.

2. **MakeCredential / ActivateCredential** -- metalman encrypts the bootstrap
   token using the TPM's EK. Only the machine with the matching TPM can decrypt
   it via `ActivateCredential`.

3. **AES-256-GCM** -- The actual token payload is encrypted with AES-256-GCM,
   with the key wrapped by the TPM credential.

This ensures that bootstrap tokens cannot be intercepted by other machines on
the network.

### MachineOperation-Based Operations

metalman supports day-2 host operations through `MachineOperation` resources:

- **HostReboot** -- Restarts the machine through Redfish.
- **HostReplace** -- Sets the PXE or HTTP boot override, force-restarts the
  machine, writes the selected image, and waits for first-boot cloud-init and
  the Kubernetes Node object.

Progress is recorded on the `MachineOperation` target state and conditions such
as `BootImageWritten` and `CloudInitDone`.
